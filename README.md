# Turtle Speedway

A Unity game about a speedy turtle that seems oddly familiar to a League of Legends character... OK!

## Running the project
You can conveniently play the build on the web from this site (via Unity Play):

*TBD*

Alternatively, if you are familiar with Unity, you can grab the version that this project was built with here (This project was built with Unity version **6000.3.5f2**, but a later version is probably fine too):

https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/6000.3.5f2

You can then clone this repro to a folder on your computer.

Once you have Unity installed, you will most likely have Unity Hub installed.

Using Unity Hub you can go to the "projects" tab and "Add project from disk" (not "new project"!).

Now navigate to the folder of the cloned repo and open it.

You should see the project listed in Unity Hub now, last step is to click on it to open it.
